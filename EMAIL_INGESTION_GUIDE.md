# üìß Email Recipe Ingestion Guide

## üéØ Overview

The Email Recipe Ingestion feature allows approved email addresses to send recipe photos to a dedicated system email address, which are automatically processed and added to the Plenary Pantry database. This is perfect for sharing recipes with family members, friends, or team members who can send recipe photos from their phones or computers.

## üöÄ Features

### **Approved Sender System**
- Centralized approved sender list for the entire system
- Any email on the approved list can send recipe photos
- Senders can be activated/deactivated as needed
- Optional sender names for better identification

### **Automatic Processing**
- Emails are automatically polled and processed
- Image attachments are extracted and processed with OCR
- Recipes are automatically normalized and saved to the database
- Duplicate detection prevents recipe conflicts

### **Comprehensive Tracking**
- Full email history with sender information
- Attachment processing status and error tracking
- Detailed processing logs for debugging
- Admin interface for monitoring and management

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Configuration

### **1. Email Server Configuration**

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Ingestion Settings
EMAIL_INGESTION_IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com
EMAIL_INGESTION_IMAP_PORT=993
EMAIL_INGESTION_EMAIL=your-recipe-email@domain.com
EMAIL_INGESTION_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_INGESTION_USE_SSL=True
EMAIL_INGESTION_FOLDER=INBOX
EMAIL_INGESTION_POLL_INTERVAL=300
EMAIL_INGESTION_RECIPIENT_ALIAS=recipes@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_INGESTION_MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE=10485760
EMAIL_INGESTION_DEFAULT_USER="julia.guimiot@gmail.com"
```

### **2. Gmail Setup (Recommended)**

For Gmail, you'll need to:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security ‚Üí 2-Step Verification ‚Üí App passwords
   - Generate a password for "Mail"
   - Use this password in `EMAIL_INGESTION_PASSWORD`

3. **Configure IMAP**:
   - Gmail Settings ‚Üí Forwarding and POP/IMAP
   - Enable IMAP access

### **3. Other Email Providers**

The system supports any IMAP-compatible email provider:

- **Outlook/Hotmail**: `outlook.office365.com:993`
- **Yahoo**: `imap.mail.yahoo.com:993`
- **Custom IMAP**: Configure your server details

## üì± Usage Instructions

### **For Recipe Senders**

1. **Take Photos**: Capture clear photos of recipe cards, cookbook pages, or printed recipes
2. **Send Email**: Compose an email to the configured recipe email address (the `EMAIL_INGESTION_RECIPIENT_ALIAS`)
3. **Attach Photos**: Add the recipe photos as attachments
4. **Send**: The system will automatically process the images

**Important**: The email must be addressed to the exact recipient alias configured in `EMAIL_INGESTION_RECIPIENT_ALIAS`. This ensures only emails intended for recipe ingestion are processed.

**Tips for Better Results:**
- Use good lighting and avoid shadows
- Take photos from directly above the recipe
- Ensure text is clear and readable
- Use high resolution photos
- Avoid blurry or angled shots

### **For System Administrators**

1. **Set Up Approved Senders**:
   ```bash
   # Add approved email senders
   uv run python manage.py manage_approved_senders --add "friend@example.com"
   uv run python manage.py manage_approved_senders --add "John Doe <john@example.com>"
   ```

2. **Start Email Polling**:
   ```bash
   # Run once (test)
   uv run python manage.py poll_emails --once
   
   # Run continuously (recommended for production)
   uv run python manage.py poll_emails --interval 300
   ```

3. **Monitor Processing**:
   - Check the Django admin for email sources and attachments
   - View approved sender list and status
   - Review processing logs for any issues

## üîß Management Commands

### **Email Polling**

```bash
# Poll emails once and exit
uv run python manage.py poll_emails --once

# Poll emails continuously with custom interval
uv run python manage.py poll_emails --interval 300 --verbose

# Default: polls every 5 minutes (300 seconds)
uv run python manage.py poll_emails
```

### **Approved Senders Management**

```bash
# List all approved senders
uv run python manage.py manage_approved_senders --list

# Add a new approved sender
uv run python manage.py manage_approved_senders --add "john@example.com"
uv run python manage.py manage_approved_senders --add "Jane Smith <jane@example.com>"

# Activate an approved sender
uv run python manage.py manage_approved_senders --activate "john@example.com"

# Deactivate an approved sender
uv run python manage.py manage_approved_senders --deactivate "john@example.com"

# Remove an approved sender
uv run python manage.py manage_approved_senders --remove "john@example.com"
```

sudo systemctl start plenary-pantry-email-polling

# Using supervisor
[program:email-polling]
command=/path/to/venv/bin/python manage.py poll_emails
directory=/path/to/project
autostart=true
autorestart=true
user=www-data
